# Tester

## How to use

1. Put your Java code beside the `tester.py` file.
2. Put the test cases in the directory `tests/in` (inputs should go here) and `tests/out` (outputs should go here) in numerical order starting from 1. each input file should be named `inputX.txt` and its corresponding output should be named `outputX.txt` for some integer `X`.
3. Set the time limit for each test case in line 10 of `tester.py`, tester will notify you when your code has exceeded the time limit for a test.
4. Run `tester.py` and wait for the results. Good luck judging your code. :)
